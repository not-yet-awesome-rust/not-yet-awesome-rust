[File an issue](https://github.com/ErichDonGubler/not-yet-awesome-rust/issues/new), and we'll do the research for you! :) KEEP IN MIND that this is an open-source project, and that manpower therein is limited -- the more specific you can get with your use case, the more likely it is you'll get a timely and informative response.

### Hey, there's something on this list, but Rust HAS something for it!

[Open an issue](https://github.com/ErichDonGubler/not-yet-awesome-rust/issues/new) so we can cross 'er out and make sure people know!
* Feel free to open an issue when you have a library that *satisfies the use cases* that are listed here -- knocking them off can only be a good thing.
    * You may also want to submit your work to [awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust), if you think it's good enough!
* For now, items will NOT be deleted from this list -- merely crossed out ~~like this~~, so people can come back and see if progress has been made on what they care about.
