# Not-Yet-Awesome Rust

A curated list of Rust code and resources that do **NOT** exist yet, but would be beneficial to the Rust community.

The purpose of this list is twofold:

* Enumerate **specific use cases and their problems domains** that do not yet have a robust ecosystem in Rust.
    * The definition of "specific" and "robust" for this list is yet to be determined!
* Encourage the Rust community to approach gaps in the Rust ecosystem by providing this list as a point of collaboration!

## FAQ

### I don't see what I'm looking for, is it actually missing?

File an issue, and we'll do the research for you! :) KEEP IN MIND that this is an open-source project, and that manpower therein is limited -- the more specific you can get with your use case, the more likely it is you'll get a timely and informative response.

### I want to contribute!
### I don't see something I care about/think is {useful,important}!

If you're viewing this on the Github website, you can [edit this `README.md` file in your browser](https://github.com/ErichDonGubler/not-yet-awesome-rust/edit/master/README.md). Click the little pencil icon at the top right, and use the Markdown editor to send us a PR ASAP:

If you're not using Github...send us a PR anyway. We want to know!

### Hey, there's something on this list, but Rust HAS something for it!

Open an issue so we can cross 'er out and make sure people know!
* Feel free to open an issue when you have a library that *satisfies the use cases* that are listed here -- knocking them off can only be a good thing.
    * You may also want to submit your work to [awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust), if you think it's good enough!
* For now, items will NOT be deleted from this list -- merely crossed out ~~like this~~, so people can come back and see if progress has been made on what they care about.

## The List

### Data forensics
* Ability to parse `Registry.pol` files from Windows machines
